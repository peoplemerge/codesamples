Develop an application for describing operations on different types of vehicles. The
application doesn’t’ have to be fully functioning, but implement the core classes that
would be needed for the task. The basic operations should be:
1. Accelerate (slow, fast, really-fast)
2. Stop (stopping – slowly, stopping, stopping-fast)
3. Top speed( mph )
4. Engine types (diesel, hybrid, rotary, gasoline).

The types of vehicles are:
1. Semi-truck (diesel, 80 mph)
2. Ferrari 458(gasoline, 210 mph)
3. Honda S2000 (gasoline, 141 mph)
4. Toyota Prius(hybrid,120 mph)
5. Mazda RX-8 (rotary, 135 mph)
6. Mazda RX-7 (rotary, 165 mph)
7. Honda Insight (hybrid, 120mph)

Example:

Calling the Accelerate method for the Ferrari 458 should output “really –fast”

Calling stop for the Semi-truck should output “stopping-slowly”
